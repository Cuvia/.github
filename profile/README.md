  <h1>Cuvia</h1>
  <p><em>Everything is a component.</em></p>
</div>

Cuvia is an open ecosystem for building web interfaces—**one composable component at a time**.

We believe that every piece of a user interface, from a single pixel of spacing to a complex layout, should be:
- ✅ **Atomic** – small, focused, and reusable  
- ✅ **Composable** – designed to work together seamlessly  
- ✅ **Theme-aware** – adaptable to any design system  
- ✅ **Framework-agnostic** – usable anywhere on the web  

This organization will host a collection of:
- 🧩 **UI components** (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)  
- 🎨 **Design tokens & foundations**  
- 🛠️ **Developer tooling** for component workflows  
- 📚 **Documentation & best practices**

All code will be open source, well-tested, and built with modern web standards.
